# Luky
#### An extension of Lua that runs on Lua and JavaScript

## Ideas
Make stuff easy but extensible
Bootstrap in JS, Write the parser in Luky
Make something like Parslet
Pretty much compatible with Lua

## Syntax
let instead of local
func instead of function
Use # to get arguments
@ means self

Better for loop
